Demo App using cataas.com

This app will hopefully show my years of experience in iOS app development. What this app will not show is my creative mind. While I am skilled at programming beautiful UIs, I am not skilled at designing them. 
So this app is the definition of "Beauty is what lies inside". Some mocks and Unit testing was added, not a whole lot is tested due to time constraints. When I have more time I will add MockCacheManger and tests for caching images as well as tests for UI and other view models. 
Hope you enjoy the picture of the cats and the thought and origniziation I put into coding this app. 

# Installing the App
As I did not want to upload this app to the App Store for public release, I am distrubiting this app on Firebase App Distribution with an Ad-Hoc Profile. 

If you would like to download this app email me at vishal.polepalli@gmail.com with your iPhones' UDID and an email linked to a Google Account. 

Once this is done. I will add your UDID to the profile and re-archive an app for Firebase App Distribution. I will add you as a tester, and you will recieve an email from Firebase with steps to follow to install and run the app.
